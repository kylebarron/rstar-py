# rstar

Python bindings to the Rust [`rstar`](https://github.com/georust/rstar) library for creating R* Trees.

At the moment, this is functional but very few Rust methods are wrapped. This is mainly used to test different methods for [spatially partitioning GeoParquet files](https://github.com/kylebarron/spatially-partitioned-geoparquet).

Raise an issue to discuss exposing other methods.
